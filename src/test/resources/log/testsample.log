I  can’t recall much from my childhood. For all I know, I was a piece of furniture—an inanimate object. A cactus in its pot. A collection of pieces gathered through my mother’s struggles—the burnt toaster left on the snow-covered roof, the shattered drinking glass, the missing sofa that left a void across from the television set, the colorless metal bunk beds, the full-sized mattress yearning for its own frame, boxes of nonessentials locked in the attic with the dead birds, the toy box overflowing with decapitated toys, and, of course, the hot iron left dangerously near the bed.
